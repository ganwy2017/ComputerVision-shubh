<h1>Parameter Uncertainty</h1>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The parameter uncertainty is estimated by a variance for each of the
six transformation parameters (3 for the translation offset and 3 for
rotation). The parameter uncertainty is estimated by adapting the Jackknife
resampling method. It should be noted that the results obtaind are only an
approximation of the actual variance of the parameters, which are also only a
statistical measure of the actual error in the transformation.</strong></p>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>Jackknife resampling was originally suggested by Quenouille [1]. The
main idea of the method is obtaining Jackknife samples. These are simply
obtained by removing one data reading from the entire sample. Consequently, the
number of samples will mount to be equal to the number of data readings. For
each sample, the parameters are calculated and the entire set of parameters is
used to calculated the standard error of the parameters (For details on the
implementation of the Jackknife resampling method, refer to [2]).</strong></p>
